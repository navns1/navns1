### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Navneeth(Nav), an economics graduate from Sussex with a passion for quantitative finance. 

Pursuing modules such as financial economics, econometrics, and data coding, ignited my interest into the field of quant. This led me to complete relevant projects such as: assessing the financial performance of equities, backtesting SMA trading strategies, and using NLP techniques to determine price fluctuations.

Iâ€™m currently working on completing projects specific to options pricing/trading bots.
